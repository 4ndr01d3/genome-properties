About Genome Properties
=======================

Genome properties is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein family markers within that genome. Properties (which often describe pathways) are composed of steps, where each step refers to the particular protein required for the function of that step within the pathway/property. Users can browse the current set of Genome Properties, which are arranged within a hierarchy, examining the specific steps defined within each property. Alternatively, the properties can be compared in terms of the species they are found/not found in, across a modifiable set of genomes using our interactive viewer.


InterPro is a resource that classifies protein sequences into families and predicts the presence of domains and important sites. It does this using predictive models, known as signatures, provided by several different member databases. Genome properties uses such protein signatures as evidence to determine the presence of each step with a property. Integrating genome properties into InterPro allows us to build on the infomration in both resources to improve the functional annotation of protein sequences and proteomes.
