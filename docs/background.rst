About Genome Properties
=======================

Genome properties (GP) is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein family markers within that genome. For example, a genome can be 

Protein families better than sequence, but dep on InterPro.
- Much small, more sensitive, there quick to calculate. 
- All uniprot sequence already come with InterPro matches
- Link to calculation

Original conception and why we use interpro now
- InterPro have many specific families as well as general families and domains
- Specific is what we primarily use to assert the functions in GP
