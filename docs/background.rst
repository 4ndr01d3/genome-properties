About Genome Properties
=======================

Genome properties (GP) is an annotation system whereby functional attributes can be assigned to a genome, based on the presence of a defined set of protein family markers within that genome. For example, a species can be proposed to synthesise ectoine if it can be shown that the genome for that species encodes all the necessary proteins required to carry out the various biochemical steps in the ectoine biosynthesis pathway. While it is possible to infer this kind of information through analysis of genomic sequence, using protein family models, like those utilised by InterPro, reduces the number of calculations while at the same time increasing the sesitivity of the query. Integrating the GP annotations into InterPro makes the process of calculating a genome property for any given genome/proteome faster and more accurate than by sequence comparison. The process is further streamlined by the fact that all UniProt sequences, already come with InterPro matches calculated.

How to access Genome Properties data
------------------------------------

**Browse by Genome Propery**
You can browse to your GP of interest using the hierarchy browser. GPs are arranged into categories and subcategories for easy naviagtion. Each GP contains a descriptive abstract describing the property, as well as the individual steps comprising it. For more infomration on the content of the GP files, see here (link to flatfile description).

**Browse by Proteome/Genome**
You can browse GPs by genome/proteome using our matrix style viewer.

Background
----------
- InterPro have many specific families as well as general families and domains
- Specific is what we primarily use to assert the functions in GP
