CC  This genome property represents an uncharacterized three gene cassette.
CC  One gene resembles GNAT-family acetyltransferases, another resembles a
CC  peptidase, and a third resembles glutamine-hydrolyzing asparagine
CC  synthases. This cassette is sparsely and somewhat broadly distributed,
CC  occurring in the Mycobacteria and a member of the Chlorobi as well as
CC  in numerous alpha, beta, and gamma Proteobacteria.
