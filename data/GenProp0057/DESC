DC  Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism
DR  KEGG; map00760;
CC  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine
CC  dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) also known as pyridine nucleotides, are
CC  cofactors involved in numerous redox reactions through reversible
CC  reactions to their reduced forms NADH and NADPH.      In bacteria, NAD+
CC  is synthesized in a 5 step reaction (NadABCDE) from L-aspartate and
CC  NADP+ is made from NAD+ by the action of NAD kinase.    In mammals, an
CC  altenative pathway exists in which the intermediate quinolinate is made
CC  from L-tryptophan.    NAD+ may also be recycled from nicotinamide after
CC  nucleosidease cleavage, or synthesized from imported nicotinate
CC  (niacin).
