RT  Uptake and synthesis of compatible solutes as microbial stress
RT  responses to high-osmolality environments.

CC  Cells can resist dessication, high salt, and other osmotic stresses by
CC  modulating levels of osmolytes, compatible solutes that can exists in
CC  high concentrations without damaging cells. Some osmolytes may have
CC  secondary functions for carbon and energy storage molecules or for
CC  further biosynthetic reactions. Widely distributed compatible solutes
CC  induced by osmotic stress include trehalose, glucosylglycerol, sucrose,
CC  mannitol, glycine betaine and other betaines, ectoine and
CC  hydroxyectoine, glutamate, N-acetylglutaminylglutamine amide, etc.
**  Related to storage polymers, but for small, soluble molecules like
**  disaccharides.
