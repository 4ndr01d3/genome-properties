CC  2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate is made in three steps from chorismate by the
CC  action of enzymes 5.4.4.2, 3.3.2.1, and 1.3.1.28. It can then be
CC  activated by (2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate synthase (EC 2.7.7.58) to
CC  become a substrate for nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS) such as
CC  those that make catecholate siderophores.
