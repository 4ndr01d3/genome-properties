CC  A pathway has been described in which two FMNH2-dependent members of
CC  the bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) family convert
CC  dimethyl sulfone (DMS02) first to methanesulfonate (MSA), then from MSA
CC  to inorganic form. The enzymes are the dimethyl sulphone monooxygenase
CC  SfnG (TIGR04021) and methanesulfonate sulfonatase (an alkanesulfonate
CC  monooxygenase) SsuD.
