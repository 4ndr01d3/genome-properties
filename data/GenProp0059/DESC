CC  A type I protein secretion system is an ABC transporter. The system is
CC  Sec-independent. ATP drives the transport of target proteins across
CC  both inner and outer membranes and into the extracellular medium. There
CC  is no cleaved N-terminal signal sequence. Instead, the type I system
CC  recognizes C-terminal information, localized to the last 50 amino acids
CC  or less. Characteristic sequence found nearby, such as repeats of the
CC  motif GGXGXDXXX in Erwinia, may play a supporting role, possibly for
CC  chaperoning the rest of the protein rather than for recognition of the
CC  export signal (reference PMID:11157948).  This property does NOT cover
CC  ABC transporter-mediated processing and secretion of class II
CC  bacteriocins of certain Gram-positive bacteria, because of the
CC  following differences: there is no outer membrane to traverse and no
CC  TolC homolog. N-terminal signal recognition and proteolytic processing
CC  (at a GG motif) occurs together with transport. Finally, the secreted
CC  peptides are small, and lack the GGXGXDXXX motif repeated in larger
CC  proteins of class I secretion systems.
**  examples:  Erwinia chrysanthemi degradative enzymes (prtDEF
**  transporter, prtG a target).  E. coli alpha-haemolysin secretion: hlyB,
**  hlyD, tolC  (tolC may be multifunctional, completing type I secretion
**  and other functions).
