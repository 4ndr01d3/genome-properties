CC  A type I protein secretion system is an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) 
CC  transporter. The system is Sec-independent. ATP drives the transport of 
CC  target proteins across both inner and outer membranes and into the 
CC  extracellular medium. There is no cleaved N-terminal signal sequence. 
CC  Instead, the type I system recognizes C-terminal information, localized 
CC  to the last 50 amino acids or less. Characteristic sequence found 
CC  nearby, such as repeats of the motif GGXGXDXXX in Erwinia, may play a 
CC  supporting role, possibly for chaperoning the rest of the protein rather 
CC  than for recognition of the export signal [1].  This property does NOT 
CC  cover ABC transporter-mediated processing and secretion of class II 
CC  bacteriocins of certain Gram-positive bacteria. 
**  This is because of the followingg differences: there is no outer 
**  membrane to traverse and no TolC homolog. N-terminal signal recognition 
**  and proteolytic processing (at a GG motif) occurs together with 
**  transport. Finally, the secreted peptides are small, and lack the 
**  GGXGXDXXX motif repeated in larger proteins of class I secretion 
**  systems. examples:  Erwinia chrysanthemi degradative enzymes (prtDEF
**  transporter, prtG a target).  E. coli alpha-haemolysin secretion: hlyB,
**  hlyD, tolC  (tolC may be multifunctional, completing type I secretion
**  and other functions).
