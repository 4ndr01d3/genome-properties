CC  Phosphonates are compounds similar to phosphates, but in which a direct
CC  carbon-phosphorous bond replaces a carbon-oxygen-phosphorous linkage.
CC  They chelate metals, adsorb strongly to surfaces, and are produced and
CC  used industrially to prevent formation of scale on surfaces. The C-P
CC  bond is remarkably stable compared to phosphate bonds, and phosphonate
CC  utilization is rather uncommon. While some enzymes with fairly narrow
CC  specificity are known that cleave the most common naturally occurring
CC  phosphonates, this property describes a multisubunit C-P lyase system
CC  with broad specificity. The specificity may differ from one case to
CC  another, and two systems with overlapping but non-identical
CC  specificities may occur in a single genome.
**  PMID:11481431 All members of the Rhizobiaceae, including strain Rm1021,
**  have been reported to be able to use phosphonates as a source of
**  phosphate (56); several gene clusters involved in phosphonate
**  degradation are located on pSymB (phnA, phnGHIJKL, phnM, and phoCDET).
