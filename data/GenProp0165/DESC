RT  Division site selection in Escherichia coli involves dynamic
RT  redistribution of Min proteins within coiled structures that extend
RT  between the two cell poles.

RT  A dynamic model for determining the middle of Escherichia coli.

CC  The MinCDE proteins are organized into extended membrane-associated
CC  coiled structures that wind around the cell between the two poles. 
CC  These structures, and changes (pole-to-pole oscillations) in the
CC  distribution of the MinCDE proteins within them over time, are required
CC  for the proper placement of the cell division septum at midcell [1,2].
CC  This system is aparrently absent from Archaea, Actinobacteria,
CC  Bacteroides, Chlamydia, Staphylococci, Steptococci, Mollicutes and
CC  Spirochaetes. 
**  testing stage for now.  Hey, in genome gcs, looks like it points to DNA
**  repeats. Is that general?
