CC  In E. coli biosynthesis of the O-antigen consists of initiation by
CC  ligation of (usually) N-acetyl-glucosamine to undecaprenylphosphate
CC  (Und-P) to form Und-PP-GlcNAc, followed by O-antigen specific ligation
CC  of several nucleotide triphosphate sugars onto the initiating GlcNAc
CC  residue.  The completed Und-PP-O-antigen monomer is transferred to the
CC  periplasmic face of the membrane, polymerized and ligated to the lipid
CC  A outer core by one of three systems: The Wzy-dependent path consisting
CC  of Wzx, Wzy, and Wzz; the ABC-transporter-dependent pathway and the
CC  synthase-dependent pathway.  The Wzy-pathway is most common in E. coli.
