CC  This two-step pathway in purine biosynthesis begins with IMP (inosine
CC  monophosphate), a branch point in purine de novo biosynthesis.
CC  Adenylosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.4), product of the PurA gene,
CC  catalyzes the first committed step to AMP. Adenylosuccinate lyase (EC 
CC  4.3.2.2), product of the purB gene, catalyzes the second and final
CC  step, but it also catalyzes the eighth step in IMP biosynthesis.
**  So PurA is marker for this property and PurB is not, since it is shared
**  with 4051
