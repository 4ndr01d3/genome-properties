CC  YES  NO    This describes the property of having at least one intein
CC  encoded anywhere in the genome, including within proteins that belong
CC  to plasmids or phage regions.  An intein should appear as a large
CC  insert in just one or two sequences of a multiple alignment with a hit
CC  region for TIGR01445 toward the left end of the insert and a hit to
CC  TIGR01443 toward the right. The region between may show endonuclease
CC  homology.
