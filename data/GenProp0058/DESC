CC  Menaquinone (also known as Vitamin K2) is one of the quinone cofactors
CC  which play an essential role in hydrogen transfer reactions,
CC  particularly during anaerobic respiration. Menaquinone in E. coli and
CC  various other bacteria is synthesized from chorismate, 2-oxoglutarate,
CC  polyprenyl-pyrophosphate and S-adenosylmethionine. A very similar
CC  molecule (phylloquinone, vitamin K1) is found in cyanobacteria and
CC  plants which contains a shorter isoprenoid (phytyl) chain which in
CC  which three of the four double bonds are reduced. In animals, both
CC  vitamins K1 and K2 act as cofactors for gamma-carboxylation of
CC  glutamate (Glu -> Gla) which is critical for coagulation factors. Note
CC  that an alternative pathway to menaquinone biosynthesis operates in
CC  Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptomyces, and other
CC  species (see PMID:18801996). That pathway is not described here.
