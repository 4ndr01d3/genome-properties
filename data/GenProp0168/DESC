CC  Glycogen and starch are related glucose storage polysaccharides. Alpha
CC  1,4 glucan linkages predominate, with some branching using alpha 1,6
CC  linkages. The relative level of branching determines whether the
CC  substance is called glycogen or starch. In bacteria and plants, the
CC  precursor is ADP-glucose. In animals, the precursor is  UDP-glucose.
CC  Different forms of glycogen synthase are used for the two. This
CC  property is developed here as a system and includes the enzyme
CC  phosphorylase (glycogen phosphorylase or starch phosphorylase,
CC  depending on context) necessary to release glucose-1-phosphate from the
CC  polysaccharide.  It is not yet defined here whether glycogen-like
CC  storage polymer systems, such as found in Streptococcus mutans, will be
CC  included within this property or not.
