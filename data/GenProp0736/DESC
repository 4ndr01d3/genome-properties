CC  The enzyme phosphonatase (PhnX) catalyzes the hydrolysis of
CC  phosphonoacetaldehyde via a bicatalytic mechanism involving a specific
CC  enzyme lysine which forms a Shiff base with the aldehyde, and a
CC  magnesium-aspartate (HAD-type) nucleophile to cleave the
CC  (now-activated) phosphonate carbon-phosphorous bond.  The model for
CC  PhnX (TIGR01422) effectively identifies the clade of enzymes which are
CC  associated with the PhnW enzyme that provides the substrate for the
CC  reaction.  Genes mosty closely related to PhnX (modelled by TIGR03351,
CC  HpnX) share a significant degree of similarity at critical catalytic
CC  sites suggesting that it, too, acts as a phosphonatase on a
CC  beta-phosphonoaldehyde.  HpnX genes are often found in the vicinity of
CC  (and uniformly in the same genomes with) a family of FAD-dependent
CC  oxidoreductases (TIGR03364, HpnW).  These genes may act in an analagous
CC  fashion to PhnW by converting an aminophosphonate into an aldehyde,
CC  here by oxidative deamination.  HpnW genes are members of a larger
CC  family of genes (PF01266) including enzymes with amino acid deaminating
CC  oxidase activities.  This pair of genes often also is associated with a
CC  family of Zn++ dependent alcohol dehydrogenases of the PF00107 family
CC  (TIGR0####).  Other genes in the vicinity of these three indicate a
CC  phosphonate-related context and are typically observed near other
CC  phosphonate catabolic pathways such as genes of the HDIG domain family
CC  (PF01966), certain GntR-type transcriptional regulators and
CC  phosphonate-related transporters.
