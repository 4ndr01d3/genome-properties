CC  This Genome Property describes a system with two known components,
CC  restricted so far to halophilic archaea. One is a radical SAM (or
CC  occasionally pseudo-SAM)/SPASM domain enzyme, family TIGR04347. The
CC  other, family TIGR04031, resembles the PaaH (or PaaB) subunit of the
CC  phenylacetate-CoA oxygenase complex. Unlike systems in which a radical
CC  SAM/SPASM enzyme acts on a peptide substrate, this system may instead
CC  act on a(n unknown) small molecule substrate.
