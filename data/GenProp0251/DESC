CC  This property describes an energy-dependent protease, one of whose
CC  tasks is degradation of abortively translated proteins tagged by the
CC  tmRNA trans-translation system. ClpX is an ATPase that unfolds target
CC  proteins for degradation; ClpP is a protease in complex with ClpX. SspB
CC  is an example of an adaptor that brings targets, including but not
CC  restricted to proteins tagged by trans-translation, to the ClpXP
CC  machine.
