CC  Polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHAs) are high molecular weight carbon and
CC  energy storage molecules, linear polymers in which the monomeric units
CC  have the form -[O-CHR(CH2)xCO]-. The aliphatic polyesters occur in
CC  inclusion bodies in various bacteria and archaea. The most common form
CC  is polyhydroxybutyric acid, -[0-CHCH3-CH2-CO]-. Typical biosynthetic
CC  enzymes include ketothiolases, reductases, and PHA synthases.
CC  Additional proteins may include small PHA inclusion body-associated
CC  proteins. Typical gene symbols include pha (phb for
CC  polyhydroxybutyrate) A (ketothiolase), B (reductase), C (synthase), Z
CC  (depolymerase), E (second subunit of heterodimeric-type PHA synthase),
CC  R, and Q.
**  Note that PMID:23702844 says all proks and euks make PHB of
**  medium-chain length (~100-200 residues), in lipid bilayers, and also
**  PHB of short-chain length (<12 residues) which is conjugated to
**  proteins. This property is about very high molecular weight (10,000 to
**  >1,000,000 residues) in granular deposits. Same paper says granules
**  frequently include some R-3-hydroxyvalerate and other hydroxy-acids,
**  and thus they are often referred to as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA).
