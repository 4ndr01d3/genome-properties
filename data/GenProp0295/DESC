CC  This property describes the system found in many prokaryotes for
CC  recognition, leader peptide cleavage, and N-terminal methylation of
CC  sequences targeted to the cell surface, as found in type IV pilus
CC  components, competence proteins, type II secretion proteins, and some
CC  other systems.
