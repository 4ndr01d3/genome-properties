CC  scpA and scpB (segregation and condensation) are proposed [1,2] to act
CC  with SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) in chromosome 
CC  organization. SMC is not universal, but is found in Eukaryotes, Archaea, 
CC  and Bacteria. It is homodimeric in Archaea and Bacteria. A mutation 
CC  study [2] has shown a role for scpA in DNA repair in addition to its 
CC  role in chromosome condensation and segregation. Proteins that act with 
CC  SMC may be termed kleisins. Different SMC/kleisin complexes are termed 
CC  cohesins and condensins. ScpA and ScpB are clustered in most bacteria.
CC  SMC and scpA tend to be clustered in the archaea.
