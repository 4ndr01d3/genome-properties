CC  scpA and scpB (segregation and condensation) are proposed [1,2] to act
CC  with SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome). SMC is not universal,
CC  but is found in Eukaryotes, Archaea, and Bacteria. It is homodimeric in
CC  Archaea and Bacteria. A mutation study [2] has shown a role for scpA in
CC  DNA repair in addition to its role in chromosome condensation and
CC  segregation. Proteins that act with SMC may be termed kleisins;
CC  Different SMC/kleisin complexes are termed cohesins and condensins. 
CC  ScpA and ScpB are clustered in most bacteria.  SMC and scpA tend to be
CC  clustered in the archaea.
**   ScpA and ScpB are clustered in most bacteria.  SMC and scpA tend to be
**  clustered in the archaea.
