CC  This Genome Property describes an uncharacterized oligosaccharide
CC  biosynthesis system, containing twelve or thirteen conserved sugar
CC  epimerases, glycosyltransferases, and uncharacterized enzymes. This
CC  system is common in plant-associated and soil bacteria, including
CC  multiple species of  Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and
CC  Methylobacterium. The designation rhizo-twelve reflects the species
CC  distribution favoring rhizobial bacteria and the size of the cassette.
CC  Note that this Genome Property should be regarded as still under
CC  construction until the number of components defined reaches twelve.
