CC  This fifth discovered carbon assimilation pathway is found mainly in
CC  Archaea and consists of a cycle of 16 steps in which two molecules of
CC  carbonate are consumed and one molecule of acetyl-CoA is produced. The
CC  acetyl-CoA pruduced is further condensed with another molecule of
CC  carbon dioxide to form pyruvate. To the point of pyruvate four
CC  molecules of ATP are converted to two ADPs and two AMPs, and five
CC  molecules NADPH and two molecules of ferredoxin are oxidized while one
CC  molecule of NAD+ is reduced.
