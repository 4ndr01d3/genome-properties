CC  This property describes the presence of genes for the RecBCD protein
CC  complex, which participates in at least two different processes. As
CC  exodeoxyribonuclease V, it degrades linear double-stranded DNA, as
CC  might occur by cleavage of exogenous DNA by restriction systems. It
CC  also acts to repair double-stranded breaks in DNA by homologous
CC  recombination [1]; genera that lack this complex tend to show stronger
CC  conservation of gene order between species[2]. The RecBCD heterotrimer
CC  interacts with instances of the DNA sequence GCTGGTGG in E. coli,
CC  called Chi, which are recombinational hotspots. RecBCD promotes loading
CC  the strand exchange protein RecA onto chi-containing DNA[3].
CC  Double-stranded breaks are processed by AddAB rather than by RecBCD in
CC  the Firmicutes and in alpha-Proteobacteria.
**  Note: RecBCD works closely with RecA, helps load it, for recombination
**  repair, but Buchnera seems to have RecBCD without RecA.  Note:
**  PMID:15547262 DSBs are processed by RecBCD in gram-negative bacteria
**  and AddAB in gram-positive bacteria, except they find AddAB replace
**  RecBCD in members of alphaProteobacteria such as Rhizobium etli.
