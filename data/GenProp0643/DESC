CC  An alternative to the SpeAB pathway to putrescine from arginine via
CC  agmatine (GenProp0642) involves ornithine decarboxylase (SpeC or SpeF).
CC   Ornithine can be generated via several amino acids including glutamate
CC  (GenProp0118) and possibly proline as well as the pathways from
CC  arginine represented here.  A pathway found only in eukaryotes for the
CC  biosynthesis of creatine also incidentally generates ornithine (and
CC  guanidinoacetate) from arginine and glycine.
