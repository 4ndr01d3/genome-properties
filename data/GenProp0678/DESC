RT  CcmD is involved in complex formation between CcmC and the heme
RT  chaperone CcmE during cytochrome c maturation.

CC  Assembling c-type cytochromes outside the bacterial inner membrane
CC  requires apocytochome export, heme export, heme ligation, and
CC  chaperones for both heme and apocytochromes, Of three different c-type
CC  cytochrome biogenesis systems, this is system I. It features the operon
CC  ccmABCDEFGHI in Escherichia coli and the equivalent genes in many other
CC  bacterial species.
**  Several of the HMMs have definitions WAY too narrow, so property is
**  zero-ed out in gdv Desulfovibrio, ntmm01 Methanosarcina, etc. Just
**  built TIGR04391 for a subfamily that seems to include an alternate form
**  of CcmD, November 2012. NEEDS WORK.
