CC  There are three distict types of nitrogenase system that exist in 
CC  bacteria and archea, acting in nitrogen fixation. The most common 
CC  type of nitrogenase contains molybdenum as well as iron (MoFe 
CC  nitrogenase). Alternative nitrogenases with homologous alpha and 
CC  beta subunits, but somewhat different sets of accessory proteins, 
CC  use vanadium and iron, or just iron. All species studied so far 
CC  with one or more alternative nitrogenases, also contain a MoFe 
CC  nitrogenase. This genome property consists of the structural 
CC  subunits of the MoFe nitrogenase [1].
