CC  The most common type of nitrogenase contains molybdenum as well as
CC  iron. Alternative nitrogenases with homologous alpha and beta subunits
CC  but somewhat different sets of accessory proteins use vanadium and
CC  iron, or just iron. So far, species with one or more alternative
CC  nitrogenases also contain a MoFe nitrogenase. This genome property
CC  consists of the structural subunits of the MoFe nitrogenase and
CC  specific accessory factors.
**  WARNING: Just the molybdenum-iron protein
