CC  The most common type of nitrogenase contains molybdenum as well as
CC  iron (MoFe nitrogenase). Alternative nitrogenases with homologous 
CC  alpha and beta subunits, but somewhat different sets of accessory 
CC  proteins, use vanadium and iron, or just iron. All species studied 
CC  so far with one or more alternative nitrogenases, also contain a 
CC  MoFe nitrogenase. This genome property consists of the structural 
CC  subunits of the MoFe nitrogenase.
