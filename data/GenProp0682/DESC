CC  This property describes a multiheme enzyme, cytochrome c nitrite
CC  reductase, and accessory proteins that may or may not be present. This
CC  enzyme allows formate-dependent nitrite reduction all the way to
CC  ammonia. Three of the accessory proteins are closely homologous to
CC  three genes of system I for c-type cytochrome biogenesis. This property
CC  describes the system as encoded by a seven-gene operon in Escherichia
CC  coli, six of which are modeled explicitly for this property. Several of
CC  the genes occur as paralogs of genes from the CcmABCDEFGH c-type
CC  cytochrome biogenesis system present in the same genomes. The most
CC  distinctive protein from this system is a pentaheme cytochrome c, NrfB,
CC  modeled by TIGR03146.
