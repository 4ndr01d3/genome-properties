CC  This property consists of the glycine radical enzyme, pyruvate-formate
CC  lyase (EC 2.3.1.54, also called formate C-acetyltransferase) and its
CC  activating enzyme, [Formate-C-acetyltransferase]-activating enzyme (EC
CC  1.97.1.4). In most Proteobacteria, the gene pair is accompanied by the
CC  formate channel gene focA. FocA forms a pentameric channel that can
CC  pass formate but not water, and that belongs to the same transporter
CC  family as nitrate transporter NirC.
