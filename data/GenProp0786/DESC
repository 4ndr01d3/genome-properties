CC  There are four known variations (branches) of the lysine biosynthesis 
CC  pathway via diaminopimelate (DAP). The variations occur in the steps 
CC  converting L-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDPA) to 
CC  LL-2,6-diaminopimelate. This property refers to the succinylated 
CC  branch of this pathway. This branch acylates THDPA with succinyl-CoA 
CC  to generate N-succinyl-ll-2-amino-6-ketopimelate and forms meso-DAP 
CC  by subsequent transamination, desuccinylation, and epimerization. This 
CC  branch is utilized by proteobacteria as well as many firmicutes and 
CC  actinobacteria [1].
