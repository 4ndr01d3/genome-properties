CC  These polymers of various monomer units are used as storage for energy,
CC  carbon and/or nitrogen. Sometimes these polymers are observed as
CC  granular inclusions within the cell. These systems may include enzymes
CC  for the biosynthesis and degradation of the polymer, regulatory
CC  components as well as proteins associated with the granule surface.
**  Category maybe could use some adjustment. Rhodococcus opacus can store
**  triacylglycerol for energy storage up to 75 percent cellular dry
**  weight. See PMID:18667565, etc.
