CC  These components are members of flagellar operons and, based on
CC  experimental evidence (i.e. mutational analysis or physical binding)
CC  are associated with flagella.  Insufficient evidence has been
CC  determined to further classify which flagellar subsystem is the
CC  appropriate category to place these components.
