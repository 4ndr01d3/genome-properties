DE  geopeptide radical SAM/SPASM maturase system
TP  SYSTEM
AU  Haft D
TH  0
CC  The core of this system is a putative peptide-modifying radical SAM
CC  family and its putative target, a short peptide with a Cys-Cys motif.
**  Near a TonB receptor and a sensor histidine kinase - I think quorum
**  sensing. UNFINISHED, probable quorum-sensing, with TonB and His-Kinase
**  in neighborhood also in Pelobacter propionicus DSM 2379.
