DE  Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) de novo biosynthesis
TP  SUMMARY
AU  Haft DH
TH  0
CC  This property combined the three parts of thiamin pyrophosphate
CC  biosynthesis, Synthesis of hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate (HET-P,
CC  GenProp0250), hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP,
CC  GenProp0253) and their ligation and conversion to TPP (GenProp0254). 
CC  Only by finding YES states for all three of these child properties will
CC  this property be automatically assigned a YES state.
