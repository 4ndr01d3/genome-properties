CC  The metabolism of many aromatic compounds proceeds by way of catechol,
CC  a compound chemically similar to benzene except that a pair of adjacent
CC  H atoms of benzene are replaced by OH groups of catechol. This property
CC  describes the meta-cleavage pathway, in which catechol 2,3-dioxygenase
CC  cleaves the ring at the meta position. Degradation continues to
CC  pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Some compounds degraded by way of catechol and
CC  this pathway include benzoate, toluene, salicylate, phenol, napthalene,
CC  and 3,4-dimethylphenol (dmp).
**  For now, steps labeled as for 3,4-dimethylphenol (dmp) operon. The 234
**  step is shown as an alternative to steps 2,3,and 4, but for now all are
**  in_rule=1.
