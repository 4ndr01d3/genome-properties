CC  One mechanism of DNA repair is nucleotide excision repair.
CC  Single-stranded cuts are made on both sides of a DNA lesion and the
CC  oligomer between the cuts is removed. Very few species lack this
CC  mechanism, although the insect endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola is an
CC  example. In bacteria, the excinuclease UvrABC performs only this
CC  function, so the presence of any one of the three subunits suggests the
CC  mechanism is (or was) present. Also required is UvrD or a related
CC  helicase with similar effect, but this helicase acts in other processes
CC  as well. A large number of genes are active in eukaryotes. The
CC  characteristic size of the oligomer removed is also different in
CC  eukaryotes. The status of nucleotide excision repair in the archaea is
CC  not fully defined.
