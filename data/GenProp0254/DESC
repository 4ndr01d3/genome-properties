CC  Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential cofactor for several 
CC  carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. Hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate 
CC  (HMP-PP) may be obtained by de novo synthesis, or by import or salvage 
CC  of hydroxymethylpyrimidine followed by phosphorylation. Likewise, 
CC  hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate (HET-P) may come from synthesis, import, 
CC  or salvage. The two heterocylic compounds are ligated by ThiE to thiamine
CC  phosphate. Thiamine phosphate then undegoes either dephosphorylation
CC  followed by pyrophosphorylation or direct phosphorylation [1]. 
**  This property includes both ligation and remaining steps to obtain TPP.
**  This might be a good place for various salvage models: ThiM, etc.
