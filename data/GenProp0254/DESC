CC  Hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) may be obtained de novo
CC  from a purine biosynthesis intermediate or by import or salvage, then
CC  phosphorylation, of hydroxymethylpyrimidine. Likewise,
CC  hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate may be come from synthesis, import, or
CC  salvage.  The two heterocylic compounds are ligated by ThiE to thiamine
CC  phosphate. Thiamine phosphate then undegoes either dephosphorylation
CC  followed by pyrophosphorylation or direct phosphorylation. This
CC  property includes both ligation and remaining steps to obtain TPP.
**  This might be a good place for various salvage models: ThiM, etc.
