CC  DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE form a chaperone system. DnaK has ATPase activity.
CC  DnaJ and GrpE are co-chaperones for DnaK, that is, stimulate this
CC  activity. This system is also called the hsp70 heat-shock system.
CC  Excluded from this system are the heat shock cognate (Hsc) homologs,
CC  which are associated specifically with iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis
CC  (see GenProp0138, the iron-sulfur cluster assembly iscSUA-hscBA-fdx
CC  system). The heat shock repressor HrcA is found in about half of
CC  bacterial genomes with the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE heat shock system, usually
CC  encoded upstream in a heat shock operon; it is included here as an
CC  optional component.
**  When the HcrA model hits nothing, there generally is no upstream gene
**  in operon - true negative.
