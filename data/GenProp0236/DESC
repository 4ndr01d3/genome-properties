CC  Phosphonates are a varied class of compound with a direct C-P bond that
CC  can be significantly more stable than indirect C-O-P bond of organic
CC  phosphates. Phosphonates may be toxic but also may be utilized as a
CC  sorce of phosphorus, carbon, and energy. Some species appear to have a
CC  (sometimes two) membrane-associated C-P lyase complex, PhnGHIJKLM, for
CC  degradation of many different (but not all) phosphonates, while other
CC  species have single gene-encoded phosphonatases active on specific
CC  compounds. This property represents the presence of transporters for
CC  phosphonates and related C-P bond-containing compounds (e.g.
CC  phosphites); it should be found in association with either the C-P
CC  lysase membrane complex or specific phoshonatases, but not all of the
CC  latter are known.
