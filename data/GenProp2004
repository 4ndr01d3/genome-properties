CC  Blood coagulation is the cross-linking of fibrin fibres.  Conversion
CC  of the precursor fibrinogen to active fibrin is a prerequisite.  
CC  Activation requires proteolytic removal of an N-terminal peptide
CC  from each of the fibrinogen chains, allowing isopeptide bonds to form  
CC  between active fibrin chains.  A proteolytic cascade to amplify the
CC  initial signal results in the activation of thrombin (factor 2) which
CC  releases the fibrinopeptides from fibrin.  The transglutaminase
CC  factor XIII catalyzes the formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine 
CC  cross-links between fibrin chains. Two converging pathways are
CC  thought to exist, the extrinsic and the intrinsic.  The extrinsic 
CC  pathway is initiated by the release of tissue factor.
**  The existance of the intrinsic pathway has been called into question, 
**  and the extrinsic pathway has been simplified.  This coagulation 
**  pathway is restricted to vertebrates.  Invertebrates have a different
**  pathway (determined in the horseshoe crab).
