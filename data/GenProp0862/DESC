CC  This genome property represents pyridoxal 5-prime phosphate
CC  biosynthesis as it occurs in Escherichia coli, from deoxyxylulose
CC  5-phosphate and 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine. The key proteins are PdxA
CC  and PdxJ. This pathway contrasts with the Pdx1 and Pdx2 pathway, as
CC  found in Bacillus subtilis. The current version of this Genome Property
CC  assesses only the two signature enzymes PdxA and PdxJ.
**  PdxA called 4th step by PMID: 12896974  Expect the PdxA/PdxJ pathway in
**  gamma subdivision.  PdxJ is final step. Homooctameric.
