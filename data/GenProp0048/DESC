CC  Isoprenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is synthesised in most bacteria by 
CC  the non-mevalonate pathway (also known as the MEP pathway, the 
CC  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate(GAP)-pyruvate pathway and the deoxyxylulose
CC  pathway). This is in contrast to the mevalonate pathway found in 
CC  eukaryotes. This non-mevalonate pathway contains six characterized 
CC  enzymes and may involve additional proteins as well. IPP is a basic 
CC  building block of isoprenoids, also known as terpenoids [1].
**  (DH) I added IspG, TIGR00612, but now I'm wondering if this is to make 
**  IPP or use IPP. But it is OK : PMID:11274098 says adding mevalonate 
**  fixes the problem, which means this gene is involved in making IPP, 
**  not using it.
