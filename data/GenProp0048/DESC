CC  The pathway for the biosynthesis of isoprenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) in
CC  most bacteria has been variously referred to as the non-mevalonate
CC  pathway (in contrast to the pathway found in eukaryotes), the
CC  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate(GAP)-pyruvate pathway and the deoxyxylulose
CC  pathway. This pathway contains six characterized enzymes and may
CC  involve additional proteins as well.
**  I added IspG, TIGR00612, but now I'm wondering if this is to make IPP
**  or use IPP. But it is OK : PMID:11274098 says adding mevalonate fixes
**  the problem, which means this gene is involved in making IPP, not using
**  it.
