CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described (Haft, Selengut, et al., submitted) in
CC  which certain groups of subtype-specific genes are found in addition to
CC  characteristic sets of the more widely distributed cas genes. The Mtube
CC  subtype, so named because this subtype is the only one found in the
CC  genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, consists of cas1, cas2, and the
CC  subtype specific genes csm1-5.  Csm3, 4 and 5 are members of the RAMP
CC  superfamily, and this subtype shares some similarities with the CRISPR
CC  RAMP module in that it tends to be associated with other subtypes and
CC  often forms hybrid-subtype loci.
