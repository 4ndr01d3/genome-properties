CC  7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin, or FO, is the chromophore
CC  of coenzyme F420. Several enzymatic steps convert FO to F420 (see
CC  GenProp0791). FO is also the chromophore of a cyanobacterial DNA
CC  photoreactivating enzyme [1]. The two key enzymes of this pathway, 
CC  encoded by CofG and CofH in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, are encoded 
CC  by fusion proteins in certain lineages. The fusion protein in
CC  Mycobacterium smegmatis is designated FbiC (F420 BIosynthesis C). The
CC  precursors are a pyrimidine intermediate from riboflavin biosynthesis
CC  and the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate precursor of tyrosine, so expressing
CC  FbiC in Escherichia coli is sufficient for FO biosynthesis [2].
**  Used in a METAPATH for F420 biosynthesis, since FO can be used other
**  than in F420 biosynthesis.
