**  Property seems to be in rough shape - too general, with existing models
**  covering perhaps too little. For the DeoA step, seems any pyrimidine
**  phosphorylase is allowed, while the choice of three now in seem each
**  too strict.  Removed some EC number and com_name-based evidences for
**  DeoA.  This feels more like a KEGG broad bin and less like a specific
**  JCVI Genome Property.
