CC  The twin-arginine dependent translocation (Tat) system of protein
CC  transport differs from Sec-dependent translocation in that the Tat
CC  system transports folded proteins while Sec feeds through unfolded,
CC  nascent proteins that fold after they cross the membrane. The
CC  significance is that Tat lets cofactors such as flavins or iron-sulfur
CC  clusters be retained during transit across the membrane. Targets for
CC  the system can often be recognized by a characteristic signal sequence
CC  with an Arg-Arg motif. The target proteins usually are predicted to
CC  perform redox functions. This property reflects detection of the whole
CC  system: components of the translocase and at least one example of a
CC  predicted Tat signal sequence. Every system must have at least one TatA
CC  homolog (other than TatB) and at least one TatC homolog. TatB occurs
CC  only in Proteobacteria and is required at least in E. coli. Recently,
CC  several proteins (TorD, NapD) have been shown to act as chaperones that
CC  bind the TAT signal peptide of a specific protein and delay
CC  translocation until the cofactor has bound.
**  These genomes had a qualifying TatB but not TatA/E:  gsi ntgo01 ntjs01
**  ntmc01 ntps01 gcc52592  when I separated TatB from TatA/E as steps,
**  10/6/2006 DHH.  Should probably add PF02613 TIGR03482 to list of TAT
**  chaperones (although these may do additional chaperoning functions).
