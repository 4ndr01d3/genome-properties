CC  This property describes an uncharacterized gene pair, sporadically
CC  distributed in archaea and bacteria, consisting of an upstream protein
CC  of about 880 amino acids (family TIGR02687) and a downstream protein of
CC  about 470 amino acids (TIGR02688). The downstream member is
CC  occasionally annotated (apparently incorrectly) as ATP-dependent
CC  protease La.
