DC  Tyrosine metabolism - reference pathway
DR  KEGG; map00350;
CC  4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a degradation product of tyrosine via one
CC  of several routes, of phenylalanine via phenylacetate, and of
CC  environmental DDT is metabolized in this pathway to the common
CC  metabolites succinate and pyruvate via homoprotocatechuate. 
CC  4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid may also be found in the environment and
CC  transported into the cell.  The genes encoding the components of this
CC  pathway are often organized into apparent operons which include
CC  regulatory elements as well as a variety of transport systems.  A
CC  number of genomes show partial evidence of the pathway based on
CC  homologs of the well-characterized enzymes from other species.  Often,
CC  promising candidates for the missing steps are found in the vicinity. 
CC  These are suggestive of enzymes which have been adapted from ancestral
CC  sequences having a different function.  Of course, the possibility
CC  exists that it is the entire pathway that has been modified in these
CC  species and it is other structurally related compounds that are being
CC  metabolized instead of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid.
