CC  TIGR03808 (repeats of TIGR03807) and TIGR03809
**  Still dealing with suspicion that TIGR03809 could represent a shadow.
**  On the other hand, there is a fairly deep split in TIGR03808 (only one
**  side is in seed), so setting TC at 600 instead of 150 means the one
**  side then is perfect to TIGR03809. In PhyloProf release 2, only 10
**  species hit TIGR03809, and dozens of proteins match 10/10. Additional
**  proteins crop up in conserved gene neighborhood. No go for going
**  public.
