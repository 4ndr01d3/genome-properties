CC  Certain bacteria (notably Propionobacter species) convert pyruvate to
CC  propionate as a waste end-product of anaerobic fermentation. The
CC  purpose of this pathway is to regenerate the NADH and FADH2 consumed in
CC  the production of pyruvate (and ATP) from fermentable sugars, something
CC  that cannot be done efficiently in the absence of oxygen or other
CC  suitable electron acceptor.    The essential enzyme in this pathway is
CC  methylmalonyl-CoA carboxytransferase (EC 2.1.3.1) which couples the
CC  carboxylation of pyruvate (to oxaloacetate) with the decarboxylation of
CC  (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA (to propionyl-CoA). Without this enzyme the
CC  conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate would require ATP (EC 6.4.1.1)
CC  and be considerably less efficient.    Note that a number of the
CC  components of this pathway are also elements of the TCA cycle running
CC  in reverse (malate DH, fumarate hydratase, succinate dehydrogenase).
