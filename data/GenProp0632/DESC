CC  There are three homologous types of nitrogenase; the common
CC  molybdenum-containing, the alternative vanadium (V)-containing, and the
CC  alterantive iron (Fe)-only. This Genome Property represents the 
CC  V-containing nitrogenase, which acts in nitrogen fixation. V-containing 
CC  nitrogenase is composed of three subunits encoded by three genes within 
CC  an operon: subunit alpha (vnfD), subunit beta (vnfK) and subunit delta 
CC  (vnfG) [1].
