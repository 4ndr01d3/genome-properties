CC  Three homologous types of nitrogenase are the common
CC  molybdenum-containing, the alternative vanadium (V)-containing, and the
CC  alterantive iron (Fe)-only. This Genome Property represents presence in
CC  a genome of the  V-containing nitrogenase, which acts in nitrogen
CC  fixation, and its accessory proteins.
**  WARNING: ONLY THE THREE SUBUNITS OF THE VANADIUM-IRON PROTEIN AT THIS
**  TIME
