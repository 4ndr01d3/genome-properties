CC  The enzyme nitrile hydratase (EC 4.2.1.84) catalyzes the
CC  interconversion of an aliphatic amide to a nitrile plus H20. The enzyme
CC  is closely related to thiocyanate hydrolase (EC 3.5.5.8). The nitrile
CC  hydratase alpha subunit contains active site Cys residues that undergo
CC  covalent modification, after which it binds either Fe(III) or Co(III).
CC  A CXCC-containing protein related to the cobalamin biosynthesis protein
CC  CobW is described as a nitrile hydratase activator and is often found
CC  in the nitrile hydratase operon. However, the protein family described
CC  by TIGR03889, also commonly annotated as a nitrile hydratase accessory
CC  protein, is found in a larger fraction of nitrile hydratase operons. 
**  Because some are Fe(III) and some are Co(III), the accessory protein
**  would be expected to vary. There are common clustered proteins, but not
**  universal - possibly may be used to tell Fe from Co.
