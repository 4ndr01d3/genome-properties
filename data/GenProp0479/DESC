CC  acetate and acetyl-CoA can be interconverted for a number of purposes
CC  including utilization of acetate as in acetate fermentation, excretion
CC  of acetate in the fermentation of other compounds and the biosynthesis
CC  of acetyl-CoA for other purposes.  Several different single-step and
CC  multi-step pathways are summarized in this property.  The state of this
CC  property will be YES if any of the component pathways are found and the
CC  value field will hold the number of pathways found.
