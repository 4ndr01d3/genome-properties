CC  This system consists of three components, typically in a single operon.
CC  First is a PTS system transporter (TIGR01992) by which trehalose enters
CC  the cell as trehalose-6-phosphate. Second is trehalose-6-phosphate
CC  hydrolase, or alpha,alpha-phosphotrehalase (TIGR02403). Third is a
CC  transcriptional repressor for the operon, with different families in E.
CC  coli (TIGR02405) and Bacillus (TIGR02404). 
**  no comment yet on whether a TreA should be part of this, make
**  trehalose-6-P from trehalose.
