CC  This C-terminal protein sorting signal domain CGP-CTERM (TIGR04288) is
CC  restricted to the the family Thermococcaceae (including Thermococcus,
CC  Pyrococcus, and Palaeococcus) within the Euryarchaeota. It may be
CC  universal in that family. The sorting family is unknown. By analogy to
CC  the sortase, exosortase/archaeosortase, and rhombosortase systems, it
CC  is predicted that some protein sorting and processing enzyme recognizes
CC  and cleaves the C-terminal region. The unknown putative sorting enzyme
CC  may act as a transpeptidase.
