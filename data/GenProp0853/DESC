CC  A specialized ABC transporter occurs both in species that make
CC  lantibiotics in the gallidermin family and as orphans in species that
CC  lack both the lantibiotic precursor molecule and the corresponding
CC  synthases. It appears these transporters are responsible for
CC  self-protection in species that make lantibiotics, and defense in those
CC  that do not.
