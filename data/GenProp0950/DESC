CC  dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose is an intermediate in the 
CC  biosynthesis of L-rhamnose and D-fucosamine derivatives. L-rhamnose is a 
CC  common component of the bacterial capsule and/or cell wall, and is important 
CC  in bacterial survival during infection. dTDP-L-rhamnose is the precursor of 
CC  L-rhamnose[1,2]. dTDP-L-rhamnose is synthesized from glucose-1-phosphate and 
CC  deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) via a four-step enzymatic pathway. The 
CC  four enzymes are: glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (also known as 
CC  dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, gene name rlmA or rfbA); dTDP-D-glucose 
CC  4,6-dehydratase (gene name rmlB or rfbB); dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 
CC  3,5-epimerase (also known as dTDP-6-deoxy-D-xylo-4-hexulose 3,5-epimerase, 
CC  gene name rmlC or rfbC); and dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase (also known as 
CC  dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase (gene name rmlD or rfbD)[1,2]. This 
CC  property refers to the first two steps of this pathway.
