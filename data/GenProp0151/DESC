RT  Operon mer: bacterial resistance to mercury and potential for

CC  Detoxification of inorganic and organic mercury compounds involves the
CC  enzymatic reduction of extracellular mercuric ions or organomercurials
CC  into less-toxic metallic mercury, where it is released into the
CC  cytoplasm and volatiles from the cell. Mercuric ions diffuse across the
CC  outer membrane by a mer transport system, which binds and transfers
CC  mercury ions via a pair of cysteine residues to the active site of a
CC  mercuric reductase. Alternatively, an organomercurial lyase is required
CC  for hydrolysis of the carbon-mercury bond of organomercurial compounds
CC  before reduction proceeds. Transcribed separately and divergently, a
CC  mercury-sensitive transcriptional activator both positively and
CC  negatively regulates mer expression, while a co-transcribed secondary
CC  regulatory protein down-regulates this mer operon. This resistance
CC  system, often encoded on plasmids and transferred via transposons, is
CC  found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [1].
