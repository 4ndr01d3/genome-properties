CC  dTDP-L-rhamnose is synthesized from glucose-1-phosphate and deoxythymidine
CC  triphosphate (dTTP) via a four-step enzymatic pathway. The four enzymes are: 
CC  glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (also known as dTDP-glucose 
CC  pyrophosphorylase, gene name rlmA or rfbA); dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (gene 
CC  name rmlB or rfbB); dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase (also known as 
CC  dTDP-6-deoxy-D-xylo-4-hexulose 3,5-epimerase, gene name rmlC or rfbC); and 
CC  dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase (also known as dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose 
CC  reductase (gene name rmlD or rfbD)[1]. This property refers to the final step in 
CC  this pathway, the conversion of dTDP-4-dehydro-L-rhamose to dTDP-L-rhamnose.
