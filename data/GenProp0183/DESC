CC  L-rhamnose is a common component of the bacterial capsule and/or 
CC  cell wall, and is important in bacterial survival during infection. 
CC  dTDP-L-rhamnose is the precursor of L-rhamnose[1,2]. dTDP-L-rhamnose 
CC  is synthesized from glucose-1-phosphate and deoxythymidine 
CC  triphosphate (dTTP) via a four-step enzymatic pathway. The four enzymes
CC  are: glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (also known as dTDP-
CC  glucose pyrophosphorylase, gene name rlmA or rfbA); dTDP-D-glucose 
CC  4,6-dehydratase (gene name rmlB or rfbB); dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 
CC  3,5-epimerase (also known as dTDP-6-deoxy-D-xylo-4-hexulose 
CC  3,5-epimerase, gene name rmlC or rfbC); and dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 
CC  reductase (also known as dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase 
CC  (gene name rmlD or rfbD)[1,2]. This property refers to the final step
CC  in this pathway, the conversion of dTDP-4-dehydro-L-rhamose to
