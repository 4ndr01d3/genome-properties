CC  2-aminoethylphosphonate (2-AEP) is a common phosphonate compound found
CC  in the environment and at least two related pathways are known for its
CC  catabolism.  The critical enzyme, PhnW (2-AEP:pyruvate
CC  aminotransferase) is found in both of these pathways as well as
CC  (working in the opposite direction), biosynthetic pathways. 
CC  Additionally, two different ABC transporter complexes are likely
CC  responsible for the import of 2-AEP.
