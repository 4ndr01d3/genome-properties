CC  The E. coli O1A antigen is a branched pentasaccharide with the
CC  structure
CC  [->3)aLRha{(2<-1)bDManNAc}(1->3)aLRha(1->3)bLRha(1->4)bDGlcNAc(1->]
CC  [1]. A structure with different boundaries for the repeating unit was
CC  reported [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0144-8617(92)90187-U], but is less
CC  likely considering the genomic evidence (the lack of a candidate GlcNAc
CC  transferase) and the propensity for a GlcNAc residue to be the final
CC  one in the monomer structure of many E. coli O-antigens. Slightly
CC  different structures have been reported for the O1B and O1C variants
CC  [2]. It has been suggested that the epitopic commonality is related to
CC  the branching ManNAc group [3]. The genomic data for this property
CC  derived from the APEC O1 strain, for which a detailed sub-typing is not
CC  available. Confusing matters further, the two genes which should be
CC  responsible for the pendant ManNAc group (WecB and a putative
CC  N-acetyl-D-mannosyltransferase) appear to be disrupted by single
CC  frameshifts in this genome (and both were excluded from the GenBank
CC  record). To determine rules for these two genes, the reconstructed
CC  whole genes were used as references. Although there are three
CC  rhamnosyltransferase-dependent linkages expected in the O1 structures,
CC  only two ramnosyltransferase genes are observed. Two of these linkaged
CC  are essentially identical and could easily be catalyzed by the same
CC  enzyme.
