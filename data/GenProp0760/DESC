CC  Four sequential enzymatic steps catalyze the degradation of putrescine
CC  to GABA (gamma-aminobutyrate) in Escherichia coli and related species
CC  by way of gamma-glutamylated intermediates. This modification prevents
CC  occurrence of the unstable compound gamma-aminobutyraldhyde as an
CC  intermediate. Note that mammalian cells appear to achieve a similar
CC  protection for putrescine degradation by acetylation rather than
CC  gamma-glutamylation. Genes for regulation of the system (puuR,
CC  previously ycjC), for import of putrescine (puuP, previously ycjJ), and
CC  for the conversion of GABA to succination semialdehyde (goaG) and then
CC  succinate (gabD) are associated with this pathway but not modeled at
CC  present as part of this Genome Property.
