CC  There are three homologous types of nitrogenase; the common
CC  molybdenum-containing, the alternative vanadium (V)-containing, and the
CC  alterantive iron (Fe)-only. This Genome Property represents the Fe-only 
CC  nitrogenase system (which acts in nitrogen fixation) and its accessory 
CC  proteins. Fe-only nitrogenase is composed of 2 copies each of an alpha,
CC  beta and delta subunit, forming a hexameric structure. The exact 
CC  function of the accessory protein included in this property is not yet
CC  known [1].
**  UNFINISHED:  so far only the three subunits of the iron-iron protein.
**  now includes accessory protein, so complete?
