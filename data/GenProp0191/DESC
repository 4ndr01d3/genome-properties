CC  This property describes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
CC  complex for sulfate and some related anions. Gene symbols for these
CC  proteins reflect a role of sulfate import in cysteine biosynthesis. The
CC  complex consists of four proteins, an ATP-binding protein CysA, two
CC  homologous permeases CysT and CysW, and a binding protein. In the model
CC  bacterium Escherichia coli, two binding proteins designated Sbp and
CC  CysP are present, and appear to facilitate transport of both sulfate
CC  and thiosulfate ions [1]. Unlike the case for phosphate uptake, ABC
CC  transport appears to be the only mechanism for sulfate uptake. An older
CC  report finds the sulfate transporter in E. coli also the sole
CC  transporter for selenate and selenite [2], and a review on the
CC  molybdate ABC transporter notes that, in absense of such a transporter,
CC  the sulfate transporter can take up molybdate [3].
**  Originally, CysP described as mostly responsible for thiosulfate.
