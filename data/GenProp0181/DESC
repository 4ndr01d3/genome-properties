CC  TRAP-T family transporters consists of three components, a
CC  four-transmembrane helix protein, a twelve-transmembrane helix protein
CC  and an extracytoplasmic solute receptor.  These are often found in gene
CC  clusters and the number of independent systems present in the genome
CC  may be estimated by counting the number of clusters consisting of each
CC  of the three components.
