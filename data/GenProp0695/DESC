CC  Cytochrome b558/566 is a heterodimeric, highly glycosylated, mono-heme
CC  cytochrome. It was described originally in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a
CC  hyperthermoacidophilic member of the Crenarchaeota, and is found also
CC  in related Crenarchaeota. It is suggested to work in a system analogous
CC  to cytochrome bc1.
**  still needs SoxL2 (working), SoxN.
