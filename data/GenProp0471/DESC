CC  This uncharacterized operon may be an addiction module. The downstream
CC  member (TIGR02612) is a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein in the
CC  family of PF01381. Both member proteins average under 100 amino acids.
CC  In one example so far the genes are fused. This bacterial gene pair
CC  usually but not always occurs in prophage or integrated plasmid regions
CC  of the genome.
**  Many features like addiction modules. The killer gene ORF was missed
**  initially in a number of genomes: ggs, gac_atcc, ntyp02, and may be
**  point-mutated in gtf.
