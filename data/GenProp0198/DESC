CC  RuvA, RuvB and RuvC proteins together act on Holliday junctions for
CC  homologous recombination and DNA repair. RuvAB is the branch migration
CC  complex and RuvC the resolvase [1]. The system is strictly bacterial;
CC  proteins with little or no detectable sequence similarity process
CC  Holliday junctions in Archaea, eukaryotes, and some phage. A variety of
CC  Holliday junction-cleaving (Hjc) enzymes have been found in the Archaea
CC  [2]. Holliday junction resolvases, including RuvC, Hjc and
CC  Hje, CCE1 (yeast) and A22R (poxviruses) are reviewed by Sharples [3]. 
CC  RuvC is replaced by RecU in firmicutes and mollicutes.
