CC  This property represents an ABC-type transporter for inorganic
CC  phosphate, P(i), consisting of genes related to the pstSCAB genes in
CC  Escherichia coli. In E. coli,  pstSCAB represents a high-affinity
CC  transporter and is induced by low external P(i) concentrations; a
CC  constitutive, low affinity transporter PitA, also is found. Included in
CC  this property is PhoU, a regulatory protein of unknown mechanism,
CC  generally found adjacent to the pstSCAB genes.
**  Note some variation in PstA and PstC between species, e.g. long
**  hydrophilic inserts. PstS (binding protein) is split into separate
**  families. Some info above from PMID: 11489853. DHH.
