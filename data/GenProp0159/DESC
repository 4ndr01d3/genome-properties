CC  Threonine is made from aspartate semialdehyde, a branch point
CC  intermediate in the synthesis of lysine. The aspartate semialdehyde is
CC  derived from aspartate, which in turn is derived from the Krebs cycle
CC  intermediate oxaloacetate. Homoserine, an intermediate in this pathway
CC  is a branchpoint for the biosynthesis of methionine.  Threonine itself
CC  is utilized as a starting point for the biosynthesis of isoleucine.
