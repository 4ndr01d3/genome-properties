CC  This property describes gene pairs with a member of family PF07505 and
CC  a member of family TIGR04474. Both proteins appear to be enzymes, based
CC  motif-like patterns of sequence conservation. Genomic contexts include
CC  phage contexts but other contexts as well, such as between recAX and
CC  miaB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The protein name assigned by
CC  PF07505, phage protein Gp37Gp68, is probably misleading in most cases.
**  Some stats: of 145 genomes with TIGR04474, one fusion and 102 have
**  PF07505 adjacent. In other direction, maybe fewer.
