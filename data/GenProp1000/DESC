RT  Amidoligases with ATP-grasp, glutamine synthetase-like and
RT  acetyltransferase-like domains: synthesis of novel metabolites and
RT  peptide modifications of proteins.

CC  The microviridin family (see PF12559) is an example family of
CC  ribosomally produced, post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP) for
CC  which the peptide maturases come from the ATP-grasp ligase family. This
CC  Genome Property describes a cassette with a related ATP-grasp enzyme
CC  (TIGR04187), a putative target family (TIGR04186), and a
CC  methyltransferase (TIGR04188). We propose the name TgmABC
CC  (Target/Grasp/Methyltransferase ABC) for system.
**  A Dan Haft invention. Um, turns out Iyer had published something on
**  this, have not read.
