CC  The glyxoylate shunt consists of two enzymes, isocitrate lyase and
CC  malate synthase. Its function is generally anaplerotic, meaning that it
CC  replenishes TCA cycle intermediates. Isocitrate (one intermediate)
CC  becomes succinate (one intermediate) plus glyoxylate. Glyoxylate plus
CC  an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA becomes malate, a second intermediate,
CC  for a gain of one. Acetyl groups, such as from fatty acid metabolism,
CC  by means of this pathway, can provide TCA cycle intermediates for use
CC  in amino acid biosynthesis and other biosynthetic pathways.
**  I have still never seen the glyoxylate shunt enzymes unless the TCA
**  cycle is complete.  Note: these genes should be upregulated by a shift
**  from glycolytic (glucose is supplied) to gluconeogenic (acetate is
**  supplied) conditions : let-s build an acetate update property to
**  correlate. DHH.
