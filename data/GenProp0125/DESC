CC  The basic amino acid lysine is synthesized in most bacteria and plants
CC  via a nine step pathway from aspartate (via aspartate semialdehyde
CC  which is also used in a number of other pathways). Most species utilize
CC  succinate (from succinyl-CoA) to make an important amide linkage in the
CC  ring-opening of piperidine dicarboxylate.  The succinate is then
CC  hydrolyzed several steps later.  Other species carry out analogous
CC  transformations with acetate (from acetyl-CoA).  Chlamydia and
CC  cyanobacteria have been shown to utilize a direct aminotransferase path
CC  without the acylation/deacylation steps, and a number of other species
CC  apparently also use this variant.  Each of these variants are included
CC  within this property.       A closely related variant (GenProp0788)
CC  utilizes the NADPH-dependent enzyme diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (ddh)
CC  which incorporates ammonia directly and creates the meso-isomer of
CC  diaminopimelate, bypassing the need for the epimerase, DapE.  A
CC  completely different pathway via alpha-amino adipate exists in fungi
CC  and certain bacteria (GenProp0193).     Certain obligate intracellular
CC  organisms such as Coxiella, Rickettsia and Wolbachia contain all but
CC  the final step of this pathway (diaminopimelate decarboxylase).
CC  Presumably these organisms have no need of lysine biosynthesis, being
CC  able to obtain it from their hosts. The products of the penultimate two
CC  steps, however, (LL- and meso-diaminopimelate) are required components
CC  of the bacterial cell wall and so the rest of the pathway persists. 
CC  The formal possibility that the decarboxylase exists in these organsims
CC  but is undetected requires that the state of this property remain "some
CC  evidence"  as opposed to "NO".
