CC  Gamma secretase is a complex found in cell membranes and initially
CC  identified as the peptidase responsible for the gamma, varepsilon and 
CC  zeta cleavages of the transmembrane domains of Type I membrane proteins 
CC  including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch.
**  In Drosophila, a more complex spermatoproteasome exists.
**  There is evidence in reference 4 that different forms of the
**  mammalian spermatoproteasome exist, known as small and large.  The
**  small form is a form of the immunoproteasome but with alpha4S, 
**  whereas the large form is a form of the 26S proteasome with alpha4S.
**  Presence of PA200 in the regulatory particle is crucial for
**  degradation of histones.
