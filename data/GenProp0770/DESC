CC  A siderophore is an iron-chelating molecule produced by various
CC  bacteria, especially pathogens, when iron is limiting. Bacteria will
CC  export the siderophore and re-import the iron-bound form; some species
CC  successfully import siderophores that they themselves cannot make. Here
CC  are some examples of siderophores that may be defined as Genome
CC  Properties: Enterobactin (a catecholate) siderophore. Corynebactin.
CC  Aerobactin (a hydroxamate). Yersiniabactin (a phenolate). Vibriobactin.
CC  Malleobactin. Exochelin. Pyochelin. Marine amphiphilic siderophores.
CC  Salmochelins. There are also fungal siderophores fusarinine C.
**  and more: alcaligin (Bordetella pertussis, B.bronchiseptica),
**  legiobactin , rhizobactin, rhizoferrin are, I think, all the same
**  class. Burkholderia species have ornibactin, pyochelin, cepabactin and
**  cepaciachelin. In Vibrio, also vibrioferrin, vanchrobactin,
**  anguibactin, vulnibactinn. acinetobactin (Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC
**  19606) a lot like anguibactin. Oh, and the polyhydroxycarboxylate type
**  includes rhizobactin, rhizoferrin, vibrioferring, staphyloferrin B,
**  achromobactin
