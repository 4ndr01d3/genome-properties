CC  As a coping mechanism against osmotic stress, prokaryotic organisms
CC  accumulate osmolytes or osmoprotectants from exogenous sources, to
CC  counterbalance elevated osmolarities in the environment without
CC  affecting overall cell metabolism and structural integrity. One of
CC  the most efficient osmoprotectants found in the environment is the
CC  compound glycine betaine [1]. Both gram positive and gram negative
CC  bacteria mediate osmotolerance either by direct uptake of glycine
CC  betaine from the environment, or by synthesis from exogenously supplied
CC  choline [2,3]. This genome property refers to the biosynthesis of the
CC  osmoprotectant glycine betaine from choline. Biosynthesis of
CC  glycine betaine occurs via a two-step oxidative reaction requiring a
CC  terminal electron acceptor. Choline dehydrogenase first catalyzes
CC  the conversion of exogenously supplied choline into the intermediate
CC  glycine betaine aldehyde, with subsequent oxidization by betaine
CC  aldehyde dehydrogenase into the osmoprotectant glycine betaine. Both 
CC  choline dehydrogenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase are required 
CC  for conversion of choline into glycine betaine [2,3].
