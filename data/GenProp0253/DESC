CC  Hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) and hydroxyethylthiazole
CC  phosphate (HET-P) are the two components attached by ThiE to yield
CC  thiamine phosphate, which is subsequently converted to the active form
CC  thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). HMP and HET may be imported and converted
CC  to HMP-PP and HET-P, respectively, as an alternative to de novo
CC  biosynthesis. This property reflects known steps of HMP-P de novo
CC  biosynthesis from the purine biosynthesis metabolite aminoimidazole
CC  ribotide (AIR), starting with the ThiC enzyme.
