CC  The biosynthesis of complex biomolecules generally as polyketides,
CC  non-ribosomal peptides or polyisoprenoids (terpenoids). Often these
CC  molecules are extensively modified by methylation, oxidation/reduction,
CC  cyclization, epimerization and rearrangement reactions. Common
CC  functions for such compounds are as siderophores and toxins
CC  (antibiotics). Most often these compounds are exported from the cell.
