CC  L-fucose is a component of the E. coli O157 antigen, among other
CC  polysaccharides. The starting material for this one step reaction is
CC  variously known as GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose (or ...-D-talose),
CC  and GDP-4-dehydro-D-rhamnose.  The former is most often used with
CC  repsect to this pathway since it is generally derived from mannose.
