CC  The bacterial MreBCD proteins are involved in rod shape determination
CC  and have a postulated role in the regulation of septum-specific
CC  peptidoglycan synthesis [1].  Members of the actin-like MreB family of
CC  proteins localize as a helical filament in bacteria and are important
CC  for determining cylindrical cell shape. Recent results show that new
CC  cell wall biosynthesis occurs along a helical track dependent on one of
CC  these actin homologs, providing new insights into bacterial cell
CC  growth, division and shape [2].  MreC and MreD are membrane-associated
CC  proteins.  MreC is an essential gene in B. subtilis; cells lacking
CC  sufficient quantities of MreC undergo morphological changes, namely,
CC  swelling and twisting of the cells, which is followed by cell lysis
CC  [3].  MreC and MreD may be involved in the regulation of
CC  cell-shape-related protease expression [5]. There is evidence of the
CC  existence of a separate rod-shape determining system in rod-shaped
CC  bacteria lacking the MreBCD system [4]. 
**  The genome profile for the first public version of this, mreBCD, pulled
**  up RodA and PBP-2 by Partial Phylogenetic Profiling, and often this is
**  a five gene operon. Added these steps 6/12/2007. The RodA model does
**  not include Bacillus RodA, where paralogy made it tough to include, so
**  property needs some more finishing work. MreD also needs work.
