RT  Properties and sequence of the coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol
RT  dehydratase of Clostridium pasteurianum.

CC  Glycerol can be converted anaerobically to 1,3-propanediol in two
CC  steps. Glycerol dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.30), which needs B12, removes a
CC  water and gives 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde. 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase
CC  then converts 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde and NADH 1,3-propanediol and
CC  NAD+. Model species for this pathway include Citrobacter freundii,
CC  Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Clostridium pasteurianum.
**  Note that a closely related (but different) enzyme, diol dehydratase,
**  can do the same thing with glycerol. Should set property name to
**  establish that it shows this difference.  Note that the glycerol
**  dehydratase has alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, and is assisted by a
**  two-subunit chaperone, glycerol dehydratase reactivase, which removes
**  B12 cofactor that can be suicide-inactivated by the substrate,
**  glycerol.  Note that BRAINGRAB rules of proteobacterial sequences do
**  not necessarily hit Clostridium past. seqs, so models cannot say "NO"
**  very well.
