CC  Isoprenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is synthesized in eukaryotes, archaea and
CC  certain bacteria by the mevalonate pathway (which is in contrast to the
CC  non-mevalonate pathway found more generally in prokaryotes).  The
CC  bacteria containing this pathway are believed to have acquired it by
CC  lateral transfer, possibly in more than one independent event [1]. 
CC  Archaea are believed to possess a mevalonate pathway for production of 
CC  IPP, but several of the steps are divergent from the known enzymes in 
CC  eukaryotes and have not yet been conclusively identified [2]. In 
CC  eukaryotes this pathway is highly regulated to control the production of 
CC  steroids which require IPP as a precursor. IPP is also required for the
CC  synthesis of menaquinone, ubiquinone, terpenoids, isoprene and 
CC  prenylated proteins. The pathway begins with synthesis of
CC  (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) from acetyl-CoA and 
CC  acetoacetyl-CoA by HMG-CoA synthase. The pathway contains 5 steps all of 
CC  which are included as required elements in this property. Some organisms 
CC  contain a pathway-specific acetoacetyl-CoA synthase which is described 
CC  in this property, but is not a required step. It is likely that other 
CC  species obtain acetoacetyl-CoA from beta-oxidation of fatty acids or 
CC  related processes.
