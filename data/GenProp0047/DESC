CC  Isoprenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is synthesized in eukaryotes, archaea and
CC  certain bacteria by the mevalonate pathway (which is in contrast to the
CC  non-mevalonate pathway found more generally in prokaryotes).  The
CC  bacteria containing this pathway are believed to have acquired it by
CC  lateral transfer, possibly in more than one independent event [Wilding,
CC  et. al. (2000) J. Bacteriol. 182, 4319-4327].    Archaea are believed
CC  to possess a mevalonate pathway for production of IPP, but several of
CC  the steps are divergent from the known enzymes in eukaryotes and have
CC  not yet been conclusively identified [PMID: 11042147].    In eukaryotes
CC  this pathway is highly regulated to control the production of steroids
CC  which require IPP as a precursor.  IPP is also required for the
CC  synthesis of menaquinone, ubiquinone, terpenoids, isoprene and
CC  prenylated proteins.  The pathway begins with synthesis of
CC  (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA from acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA
CC  by HMG-CoA synthase and contains 5 steps all of which are included as
CC  required elements for the assignment of the YES state for this
CC  property.    Some organisms contain a pathway-specific acetoacetyl-CoA
CC  synthase which is included in the gene lists for this property but is
CC  not a required element for the determination of the property state. 
CC  Other species likely obtain acetoacetyl-CoA from beta-oxidation of
CC  fatty acids or related processes.
