CC  The basic amino acid lysine may be synthesized by one of two types of
CC  pathways pathways in prokaryotes, the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways
CC  and the alpha-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway.  The DAP pathway has several
CC  variants including the dehydrogenase (reductive) pathway which requires
CC  ammonia and NADPH and the acetylated and succinylated pathways which do
CC  not.  A non-reductive pathway which uses neither acetate or succinate
CC  protecting groups is found in plants but has not been observed in
CC  prokaryotes.  The AAA pathway has a variant found in fungi and plants
CC  which has not been observed in prokaryotes.
