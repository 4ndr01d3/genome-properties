CC  This Genome Property describes a family of quaternary amine
CC  transporters that appears, based on physical characterization in
CC  Sinorhizobium meliloti and on bioinformatic methods to import choline.
CC  The presence of paralogs in some bacteria and their association with
CC  choline sulfatase genes suggests choline sulfate may also be a
CC  substrate.
**  WARNING: MUST REINVESTIGATE having three times as many binding proteins
**  as permease or ATP-binding. Maybe the binding include secondary
**  substrates, like choline-sulfate binding, next to choline sulfatase.
