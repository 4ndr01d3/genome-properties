CC  Cyanophycin is a characteristically Cyanobacterial storage polymer for
CC  nitrogen, carbon, and energy. It is made by cyanophycin synthetase and
CC  degraded by cyanophycinase. Cyanophycinase is also found in an
CC  extracellular form by some species that can utilize exogenous
CC  cyanophycin. The polymer has a backbone of L-aspartic acid residues
CC  (Asp), with the side chain COOH linked to the NH2 of arginine (Arg)
CC  residues. The native cyanobacterial form is insoluble, while
CC  heterogenously expressed cyanophycin synthetases in E. coli may produce
CC  a soluble form with some level of Lys substituting for Arg.  This
CC  polymer is analogous to polyhydroxyalkanoic acid biosynthesis systems
CC  with which it sometimes co-occurs.
