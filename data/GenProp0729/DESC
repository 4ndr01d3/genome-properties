CC  Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a sulfur-containing by-product from the
CC  use of S-adenosylmethionine in spermidine or polyamine biosynthesis and
CC  certain other pathways. A series of reactions, with considerable
CC  species-specific variation, recycles MTA to methionine in a wide range
CC  of organisms. In a new nomenclature, these genes are now designated mtn
CC  (MethylThioNucleoside). An interesting enzyme in this system is MtnD,
CC  the aci-reductone dioxygenase. This enzyme has two different enzymatic
CC  activities, depending on whether Ni2+ or Fe2+ is bound. The action of
CC  the single enzyme MtnP is replaced by two enzymes, MtnN and MtnK in
CC  some species. Likewise, the enolase-phosphatase MtnC is replaced by
CC  MtnW and MtnX in the Bacillus lineage. The final step in the pathway, a
CC  transamination that generates methionine from
CC  2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate, apparantly can be catalyzed by a large
CC  number of functional analogs using different amino donors, and so is
CC  not included explicitly in the reconstruction.
