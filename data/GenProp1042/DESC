CC  O128 is one of the most common atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia
CC  coli isolated from diarrhea patients worldwide. The O128(Ec) antigen
CC  monomer is a branched pentasaccharide in which an L-fucose sugar is
CC  appended, at the first sugar) to a DGal/DGalNAc linear tetramer. The
CC  WbsJ glycosyltransferase has been experimentally confirmed as the
CC  L-fucosyltransferase [1]. The terminal [aDGal(1->3)DGalNAc] linkage is
CC  assigned to the WbsH enzyme due to its high similarity to the O55
CC  antigen WbgM enzyme that carries out the same reaction. WbsK is
CC  assigned to the [bDGal(1->3)DGalNAc] reaction based in similarity to
CC  the WbnA (O113), WbnJ (O86) and WbiP (O127) enzymes carrying out the
CC  same reaction. The final enzyme, WbsL, having little similarity to
CC  other enzymes of known specificity is assigned the [bDGalNAc(1->4)DGal]
CC  reaction by process of elimination. (NOTE that the ECODAB site assigns
CC  the opposite reactions to WbsK and WbsL; we believe this to be an
CC  error.) The presence of an O-acetyltransferase (WbsI) in the
CC  biosynthetic cluster implies some degree of O-acetylation in the final
CC  O-antigen, but the location(s) and fraction of modification are not yet
CC  determined.
