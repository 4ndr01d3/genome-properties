CC  For several non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, a protein family
CC  (TIGR03110) showing considerable sequence similarity to the proposed
CC  exosortases of Gram-negative bacteria (TIGR02602) occurs in a conserved
CC  gene neighborhood. This property describes that neighborhood, which
CC  also includes a glycosyltransferase (TIGR03111) and a domain
CC  (TIGR03112) related to 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthases. These
CC  regions also include a family of proteins in the which the
CC  well-conserved C-terminal region (TIGR04145) resembles PEP-CTERM and
CC  LPXTG protein C-terminal regions. This last family may be the
CC  protein-sorting target.
**  Experimental for now, PEP-CTERM/Exosortase-related. The model TIGR03766
**  was built to add to this property, next to the region in at least three
**  genomes, but phylogenetic match is highly imperfect. Also, the
**  conserved motif at the tail end of TIGR03766 is much much broader, and
**  also a disappointment in phylogenetic profile explorations (iso_id
**  27433).
