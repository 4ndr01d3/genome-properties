CC  This property consists of type II restriction system enzymes in the
CC  family of Alw26I, Eco31I, and Esp3I, which have similar recognition
CC  sites. The m5 cytosine DNA methyltransferase has an unusual cyclical
CC  perumutation of motifs, while the endonuclease shows only remote
CC  sequence similarity to other restriction endonucleases, and the m6
CC  adenine DNA methyltransferase only remote similarity to other
CC  methyltransferases. The methyltransferases are tandem genes in some
CC  instances of this system, and a fusion protein in others. Three known
CC  recognition sequences for this family of restriction system are GTCTC,
CC  GGTCTC and CGTCTC.
**  HMM search with PF00145.FRAG vs. the C-5 cytosine-specific DNA
**  methylase shows circular permutation. For now, PF00145 is used in
**  HMM-CLUST, but should be able to be its own model.
