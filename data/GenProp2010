CC  Fibrinolysis is the disoolving of the bloot clot and naturally 
CC  follows coagulation.  Plasmin cleaves alpha, beta and gamma chains
CC  of fibrin, thereby releasing the N-terminal peptides where the
CC  isopeptide bonds, which cross-link fibrin fibres, are formed.
**  The KEGG pathway makes little sense.  Although the activation of 
**  plasminogen by coagulation factor XIIa might explain how clots are
**  dissolved in the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway, this does not
**  explain how clots are broken down in the extrinsic pathway where
**  factor XII is not activated.  Factor XIa and plasma kallikrein also
**  activate plasminogen, but again both are only active in the 
**  intrinsic pathway.  Although the important roles of the
**  plasminogen activators uPA and tPA are acknowledged, there is no
**  indication how these are activated.
