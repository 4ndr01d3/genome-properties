CC  The two genes described here are a subfamily related to MauG and to
CC  di-heme cytochrome c peroxidase, and an adjacent gene family in which
CC  members share a four-Cys motif. Additional homologs to this second
CC  protein family exist in which the four Cys residues motif is not
CC  preserved. Some members are found near TonB-dependent transporter
CC  system proteins and/or copper transport ATPases.
**  PRIVATE! A gene pair whose species include two in which a methanobactin
**  cluster includes the pair.
