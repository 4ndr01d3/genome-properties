CC  Genome Properties organized under this one describe taxonomic terms
CC  corresponding to hosts with which the sequenced organism may be
CC  associated.  NOTE: the lack of an assertion does not imply that the
CC  host range does not include species in that taxonomic grouping, only
CC  that nothing has been curated.
