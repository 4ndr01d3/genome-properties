CC  At least ten different systems of proteins associated associated with
CC  CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) have
CC  been described, such as the Ecoli, Ypest, Nmeni, and Dvulg subtypes. We
CC  designate this type Aferr, after Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC
CC  23270, where this system is carried on the chromosome rather than on a
CC  plasmid, and where it is the only CRISPR subtype in the species. None
CC  of the familiar core cas genes, cas1-cas4, is found in A. ferrooxidans,
CC  making this type of CRISPR/cas locus unusual.
