CC  These complexes act in the process of oxidative phosphorylation to
CC  create a proton gradient which powers the ATP synthase complex. 
CC  Reducing equivalents in the form of NADH and quinone from the TCA cycle
CC  stepped down in potential finally resulting in a reduced cytochrome c
CC  which, in cytochrome oxidase, pairs with oxygen as a terminal elextron
CC  acceptor.
