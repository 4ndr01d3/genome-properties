TH  0
CC  The formation from acetyl-CoA of fatty acids, any of the aliphatic
CC  monocarboxylic acids that can be liberated by hydrolysis from naturally
CC  occurring  fats and oils. Fatty acids are predominantly straight-chain
CC  acids of 4 to 24 carbon atoms, which may be saturated or unsaturated;
CC  branched fatty acids and  hydroxy fatty acids also occur, and very long
CC  chain acids of over 30 carbons are found in waxes.    
**  I created a separate pathway PlsX/Y, removing PlsX from this property,
**  as putting fatty acid onto glycerol is downstream from this pathway.
**  DHH 12/2008.
