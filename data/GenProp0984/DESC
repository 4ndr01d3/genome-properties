CC  This Genome Property is one of many in which a ribosomally translated
CC  peptide is modified post-translationally. Many of the natural products
CC  generated are bacteriocins, although bacteriocin activity cannot be
CC  presumed. An odd feature of this system is the pairing of a radical SAM
CC  enzyme (TIGR04148) with a degenerate radical SAM (pseudo-SAM) protein
CC  (TIGR04150). In family TIGR04150, despite full-length homology, some
CC  members have but other lack the radical SAM signature 4Fe4S-binding
CC  site. All members, however, are best conserved at the C-terminus, where
CC  the signature motif for the SPASM domain (as in Subtilosin, PQQ,
CC  Anaearobic Sulfatase and Mycofactocin maturases) homology 4Fe4S binding
CC  site (see TIGR04085) is invariant. This system occurs, so far, only in
CC  the Bacteroidales.
