CC  The E. coli O153 antigen is a linear pentasaccharide with the structure
CC  [->2)bDRibf(1->4)bDGal(1->4)aDGlcNAc(1->4)bDGal(1->3)aDGlcNAc(1->]. The
CC  four glycosidic linkages may be carried out by only three
CC  glycosyltransferases as the 2nd and 4th linkages only differ by
CC  position at which the transfer occurs (1->4, vs. 1->3), and only three
CC  genes are obviously glycosyltransferases in the biosynthetic cluster.
CC  On the other hand, there is one gene of unknown function which shares
CC  some homology with glycosyltransferases in the cluster, and there does
CC  not seem to be a need for any other function other than a fourth
CC  glycosyltransferase in the assembly of this O-antigen.
