CC  This Genome Property collects HMMs that describe characteristic
CC  proteins from examples of bunyavirus such as Oropouche virus, a
CC  segmented, negative-strand ssRNA animal virus. Notable features include
CC  a polyprotein with glycoprotein G2, nonstructural protein NSm, and
CC  glycoprotein G1 encoded by the M segment, an RNA polymerase encoded on
CC  segment L, and overlapping reading frames on the S segment encoding
CC  nucleocapsid protein N and nonstructural protein NSs.
**  The ends of the L protein (Bun_pol) are not modeled.
