CC  Chorismate is the final common intermediate in the biosynthesis of
CC  phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan (the aromatic amino acids) as
CC  well as menaquinone, ubiquinone, salicylate and phenazine.  Chorismate
CC  is synthesized via a seven-step pathway starting from the precursors
CC  D-erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate.  This pathway is
CC  widely distributed among microorganisms.  Certain methanogenic
CC  euarchaeota appear to be missing the first two steps of the pathway -
CC  these may be catalyzed by as of yet uncharacterized enzymes.
**  Archaea are hard to assign.  It would appear that the chorismate
**  pathway is at least partially present in archaea, since many synthesize
**  aromatic amino acids and contain some of the enzymes covered by the
**  present HMM-set.  In particular, shikimate kinase appears to be absent
**  in many archaea which contain the enzymes before and after it in the
**  pathway (Archaeoglobus, Methanobacterium, Methanococcus, Pyrococcus)
**  implying that there may be a non-orthologous enzyme.  Similarly, the
**  first two steps of the pathway appear to be missing in certain archaea
**  but are found in others.
