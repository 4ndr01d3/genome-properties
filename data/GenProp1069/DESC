CC  This Genome Property describes a putative lantipeptide-type
CC  Post-Ribosomal Natural Product (PRNP) system in which the putative
CC  precursor peptide is described by TIGRFAMs model TIGR04363. Genes
CC  always found in the vicinity include lanthionine synthetase and
CC  lantibiotic dehydratase proteins, as well a close homolog
CC  protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase, a repair
CC  enzyme for age-damaged proteins. 
**  Is finding a protein repair enzyme homolog in a PRNP cluster
**  unprecedented?
