CC  This Genome Property tracks four proteins of pantothenate biosynthesis
CC  from aspartate. PanD, aspartate 1-decarboxylase, EC 4.1.1.11, makes
CC  beta-alanine. PanB, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase,
CC  makes 2-dehydropantoate from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate. PanC,
CC  pantoate--beta-alanine ligase, EC 6.3.2.1, produces (R)-pantothenate
CC  from beta-alanine and (R)-pantoate. The genes for these three proteins
CC  tend to be clustered in bacterial genomes. The protein family
CC  distribution for a fourth component, PanE, is very different. The
CC  production of (R)-pantoate from 2-dehydropantoate can occur in more
CC  than one way (NADH or NADPH-dependent), and may be catalyzed by enzymes
CC  that may have additional important substrates (an example is the
CC  D-mandelate dehydrogenase of Enterococcus faecalis) and several such
CC  enzymes may be found in a genome.
**  TIGR00745 had been marked equivalog for PanE and is now downgraded to
