CC  This genome property tracks four proteins of pantothenate biosynthesis
CC  from aspartate; PanB, PanC, PanD and PanE. In the simplest case PanB 
CC  (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase) makes 
CC  2-dehydropantoate from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate. PanE (2-dehydropantoate 
CC  2-reductase) makes (R)-pantoate from 2-dehydropantoate. PanD (aspartate 
CC  1-decarboxylase) makes beta-alanine from L-aspartate, and PanC 
CC  (pantoate--beta-alanine ligase) then produces (R)-pantothenate from 
CC  beta-alanine and (R)-pantoate. The genes for three of the proteins (PanB, 
CC  PanC and PanD) tend to be clustered in bacterial genomes. However, the 
CC  protein family distribution for PanE, is very different. The production 
CC  of (R)-pantoate from 2-dehydropantoate can occur in more than one way 
CC  (NADH or NADPH-dependent), and may be catalyzed by enzymes that have 
CC  additional important substrates (an example is the D-mandelate 
CC  dehydrogenase of Enterococcus faecalis).
