CC  This property describes systems for polyphosphate metabolism, featuring
CC  a polyphosphate kinase (PPK1) and an exopolyphosphatase that often are
CC  encoded by adjacent genes. Polyphosphate can provide functions of
CC  phosphate and energy storage and may form granules. Genes from this
CC  system are often found next to genes of the inorganic phosphate
CC  transport system ( GenProp0190). Performing the comparative genomics
CC  for this system is tricky in part because of numbers of numerous
CC  apparent bifunctional proteins, exopolyphosphatase/guanosine
CC  pentaphosphate phosphohydrolase. Proteins of the polyphosphate kinase 2
CC  (PPK2) family are largely restricted to species with PPK1 and help
CC  produce GTP from GDP and polyphosphate.
