CC  The degradation of phenylacetic acid via phenylacetyl-CoA to TCA
CC  intermediates is the core of an extended catabolon [1] for the
CC  degradation of various monosubstituted phenyl compounds and polymers
CC  including styrene, tropic acid, ethylbenzene, 2-phenylethylamine,
CC  phenylacetyl amide, phenyl alkanoates, poly-hydroxyphenylalkanoates,
CC  and trans-styrylacetic acid.    The pathway consists of four major
CC  stages: ligation of phenylacetic acid with CoA, hydroxylation of the
CC  phenyl ring at the 2-position, oxidative ring opening and fatty-acid
CC  beta-oxidation like steps on the acyclic compound. The precise nature
CC  of the intermediates following 2-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA are not known.
CC     The gene symbol nomenclature for the enzymes in this pathway has
CC  been standardized in [1] due to the heterogeneity among the various
CC  organisms studied. This new standard is different from all of the old
CC  gene symbols, and may add somewhat to the confusion. A key is
CC  reproduced below as an aid to the bewildered.    The genes of this
CC  pathway are typically organized into a single divergon.  Some of the
CC  genes involved in the final fatty-acid-like degradation (paaABCDE) are
CC  occasionally absent and presumably substituted with genes of similar
CC  function found elsewhere in the genome.  paaA and paaB both code for
CC  genes having the same general function (enoyl-CoA hydratases), but
CC  often paaA is absent (possibly paaB in these organisms provides both
CC  activities).  paaD is the most reliable marker of this part of the
CC  pathway, nearly always detectable as a distinct homolog within the gene
CC  clusters.  paaN, which codes for the ring-opening enzyme, is generally
CC  related to aldehyde dehydrogenases, but at least three different
CC  homology families appear to have evolved members into the specific paaN
CC  role.  Pseudomonas putida appears to include a transport system
CC  (paaLM), but as this has not been reported in any other organism it has
CC  not been included in this Genome Property at this time.    Gene Name
