CC  The CatSper complex is a Voltage-gated calcium ion channel located 
CC  in the sperm tail.  It is required for sperm hypermotility and 
CC  fertility.  The complex is a  
CC  heterotetramer the centre of which forms a pore for calcium ions. 
CC  Two other subunits (delta and epsilon) are associated with this 
CC  complex.
