CC  Biotin is an essential cofactor for many carboxylation (addition of
CC  C02) reactions. This property reflects biosynthesis from pimeloyl-CoA.
CC  The source of pimeloyl-CoA may vary. BioF (EC 2.3.1.47,
CC  8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase, also called 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic
CC  acid synthetase) converts pimeloyl-CoA to 8-amino-7-oxononanoate. BioA
CC  (EC 2.6.1.62, adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate
CC  aminotransferase) converts the product to 7,8-diaminononanoate, from
CC  which BioD (EC 6.3.3.3, dethiobiotin synthase) makes dethiobiotin. BioB
CC  (EC 2.8.1.6, biotin synthase) then makes biotin itself. Enzymes such as
CC  BioH involved in pimeloyl-CoA biosynthesis typically receive
CC  biotin-related annotations but may also appear in genomes in which
CC  biotin is not synthesized and pimeloyl-CoA is used for something else.
**  Enzymes involved in the production of pimeloyl-CoA may be designated
**  bio(x) in some species, but pimelate does not necessarily lead to
**  biotin.
