CC  Methanosarcina, which has a V-type ATPase, and certain bacteria that
CC  have F1F0 ATPases, appear to have an additional novel F1F0 ATPase. It
CC  is broadly and sparsely distributed, occurring in about 2 % of
CC  prokaryotic genomes but in at least five different deeply branched
CC  lineages for the first ten systems sequenced. This form of F1F0 ATPase
CC  is uncharacterized and may reflect operation under different
CC  conditions, or in the opposite direction, or transporting a different
CC  cation.
**  It appears I did not finish building this property. It is NOT public,
**  has no rule, and has not been run. It will need more steps than it
**  currently has. Should try double-partial phylogenetic profiling for,
**  say, CT_1032. DONE: the result is CT_1033 (8/8), CT_1029 (14/16),
**  CT_1031 (13/13).
