CC  The Kdp complex is a high affinity P-type ATPase potassium ion
CC  transport system, found widely distributed among prokaryotes. Regulated
CC  by increases in osmolarity and/or reduction in external potassium, Kdp
CC  is the only K+ transport system whose expression is regulated by
CC  environmental conditions [1]. Kdp is composed of four membrane-bound
CC  subunits responsible for potassium ion binding and transport, ATP
CC  hydrolysis, and complex assembly and stability [2]. Not defined by this
CC  property are the sensor kinase and response regulator components, which
CC  once stimulated by specific environmental signals, induce expression of
CC  the adjacent Kdp gene cluster [1,2].
