CC  This nickel hydrogenase reduces coenzyme F420 (8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin) 
CC  and is found exclusively, but not universally, in methanogenic archaea. 
CC  It is lacking in at least four Methanosarcinales. F420 reducing 
CC  hydrogenase (FRH) is composed of three subuints, aplpha, beta and 
CC  gamma, which are encoded by the genes frhA, frhB, and frhG respectively.
CC  A forth gene in the same cluster, frhD, encodes a delta subunit, which 
CC  is not part of the active FRH heterotrimer, but may be required for 
CC  maturation [1].
**  These have been removed from methanogen marker set.
