CC  Bacterial lipoproteins have a modified amino terminal Cys residue with
CC  a covalently attached lipid moiety that serves as a membrane anchor.
CC  The lol system is responsible for moving lipoproteins from the
CC  periplasmic side of the inner membrane to the periplasmic side of the
CC  outer membrane. LolD is homologous to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
CC  transport family. LolC and LolE are homologous to each other (in
CC  species that have both rather than just one) and have several
CC  membrane-spanning segments, much like ABC transport permeases. However,
CC  the LolCDE complex differs from other ABC transporters in that is does
CC  not move a substrate across a membrane. Instead, it detaches
CC  lipoproteins from the inner membrane. LolA and LolB act to chaperone
CC  lipoproteins, including LolB itself, to the outer membrane. This system
CC  is less broadly distributed than the lgt/lsp/lnt system for lipoprotein
CC  N-terminal modification.
