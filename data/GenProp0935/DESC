CC  This Genome Property describes an uncharacterized system with an ABC
CC  transporter both co-clustered and phylogenetically co-distributed
CC  (although not perfectly) with a putative FMN-dependent luciferase-like
CC  monooxygenase (LLM). This system is distributed sporadically from
CC  Gram-negative (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae) to Gram-positive (e.g.
CC  Kineococcus radiotolerans). The substrate-binding protein contains
CC  enough information to guide construction of the two permease protein
CC  families, but these additional markers are not yet built.
**  Built this property because I was interested in ppp2d and a particular
**  subfamily of LLM (TIGR04028).
