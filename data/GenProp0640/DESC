CC  Xanthine dehydrogenase is a molydbopterin-containing enzyme. It
CC  converts xanthine, from the purine pool, to urate, which is
CC  subsequently degraded. In bacteria, the enzyme usually is encoded as a
CC  small subunit, XdhA, that contains FAD and 2Fe2S cofactors and a large
CC  subunit, XdhB, that contains the molybdopterin cofactor. The accessory
CC  protein XdhC is usually but not always encoded next to the XdhAB gene
CC  pair.
**  A source of molybdopterin is assumed, but not written into the property
**  yet.
