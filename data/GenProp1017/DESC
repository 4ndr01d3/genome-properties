CC  GDP-D-mannose is used as a source of mannose when coupled with the gmm
CC  enzyme, as a source of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose (GenProp0930) when
CC  coupled with the gmd enzyme (and then subsequently used to make fucose,
CC  perosamine and colicin and their derivatives). GDP-mannose may also be
CC  incorporated directly into polysaccharides such as the E. coli O8 and
CC  O9 antigens and the Klebsiella O5 antigen. The pathway consists of
CC  three acivities, an isomerase, a phosphomutase and a guanylyl
CC  transferase. The first and last steps are often catalyzed by a fusion
CC  protein (ManAC).
